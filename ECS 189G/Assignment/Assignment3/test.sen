one servant frequently migrates her horse .
the strangers again covered each quest .
a weary horse is riding unable snakes .
every lucky sovereign is carrying no fruit .
ants unfortunately know no defeater .
that king is again riding strangers .
each servant is carrying the master .
Arthur knows that the sun is hot .
the sun is hot , Arthur knows .
why is the sun hot ?
Arthur drinks from the chalice , he is drunk .
can Arthur husk a coconut ?
it snows at the mountains .
that is precisely why .
it is south of Camelot .
it snows through winter .
the king is at the castle .
Arthur rides on a horse .
the king is at Camelot .
